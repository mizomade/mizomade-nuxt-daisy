                  <h2>Founded in 2019, MizoMade.com is an online Mizo web community where people can share articles and blogs that may enrich the society with new ideas and knowledges</h2>
                  <p> The goal is to share one's knowledge and experiences through our web blog community.
                    As only a small portion of the Mizo community is technologically literate and as almost 60% of
                    the Mizo population does not know how to use a website,the resources available to the people is very limited
                    and thus this resulted in an unequal resouce  availability.
                    And also since many of the online contents are written in languages other than Mizo 
                    the language barrier thus has set a bigger barrier among the people to even learn how to work around it.
                    <br>
                    MizoMade.com is designed in a minimalistic and intuitive approach so that even
                    non-sophisticated users may know how to utilize the resources in MizoMade.<br>
                    The resources in Mizomade are 100% free for anyone.<br>
